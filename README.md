> Nuxt.js TypeScript project

## Before Running

Make sure to add a [Youtube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) key before running.

The `static/api_key.json` file should be structured as
```json
{
  "key": "API KEY HERE"
}
```

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn # or npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev # or npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build # or npm run build
$ yarn start # or npm run start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate # or npm run generate
```
